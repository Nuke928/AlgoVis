AlgoVis is an algorithm visualizer designed to simulate complex algorithms using different data structures. It could have potential use in aiding computer science student's in their comprehension in algorithms and datastructure courses.

The current goal is to implement the following data structures using integer data values:

1. Lists
2. Trees
3. Graphs

User code is written in JavaScript which is interpreted by [JS-Interpreter](https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter). All simulation and interpretation is handled on the client-side, making this app serverless.

## Development

Install the required the packages with `yarn`

Then run the webpack server with `yarn run serv`
